# odin-recipes
This project is a collection of recipes that can be navigated through multiple links.

Each recipe has it's own page with the name of the dish, a picture of the finished dish, an ingredients list, steps to complete the final dish, and a link back to the main index page.

The skills I have demonstrated with this project include;

Directory Structure and Organization:
Organized files by setting up directories, including a dedicated folder for images to keep the project structured and improve file management. This helped in linking assets more efficiently.

HTML Structure and Linking:
Created a main index.html file as the landing page and linked it to three recipe pages using anchor tags. Included navigation links on each recipe page to return to the main page.

Basic Semantic HTML & Accessibility:
Applied basic semantic HTML elements like strong, em, and correct heading levels (h1,h2,h3) to structure content in a meaningful way to improve accessibility. Included alt text on images for accessibility. 

Image Handling:
Linked images in multiple formats (.png, .webp, .jpg) to test browser support and performance. Adjusted image sizes with the width attribute to ensure proper display for all users, including those using screen readers.

Content Formatting:
Utilized ordered and unordered lists for clear content organization and used <br> tags for line breaks to format the layout.

Version Control with Git:
Managed version control by cloning the GitHub respository, using commands like git add, git commit -m, and git status to keep track of changes. Regularly commited updates through the terminal and reviewed progress with git log.

Project Documentation:
Created a basic README.md file to document project set up, file structure, and instructions, aiming for clarity and ease of use.
