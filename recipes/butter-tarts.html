        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>A butter tart is an iconic and traditional Canadian dessert! It is a flaky pastry shell filled with a rich, sweet filling that ranges from soft and gooey to runny. There are so many variations of the butter tart that there are whole festivals dedicated to this sweet treat.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Malcolm MacLeod's recipe was the first to be printed in the Royal Victoria Hospital Cook Book in the 1900's, but the butter tart has been around since the pioneers of the 1800's.</p>
