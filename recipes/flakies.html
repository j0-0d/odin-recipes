            <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to prepare Pastry:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Let Puff Pastry thaw in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Once thawed, unroll one Pastry sheet on a parchment lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Lightly brush over Milk onto the unrolld Pastry sheet.</li>
            <li>Unroll the second Pastry Sheet and place it ontop of the first Pastry sheet.</li>
            <li>Then chill in the fridge for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the Pastry has chilled, use a sharp knife and cut the Pastry into 9, or 16 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Spread the squares 1 inch apart and lightly brush Milk over tops.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the tops with Coarse Sugar and place in oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden-brown</li>
            <li>Allow the Pastry to fully cool on a wired rack.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Steps to prepare Compote:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On the stove-top in a medium pot combine Raspberries and Sugar over Medium heat.</li>
            <li>Bring mixture to a light simmer, continue simmering for 15 minutes while stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Dissolve Corn Starch into Water, then add it to the Raspberry Sugar mixture and cook for an additional 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and allow to fully cool to room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Steps to prepare Cream:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer beat together Butter, Icing Sugar, Milk, and Vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Beat until the Cream is smooth and creamy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Steps to assemble the Flakies:</h3>
        <p><em>Note: You do not need to assemble all Flakies at once if not being eaten that day. The Pastry, Compote, and Cream store well for a few days in the fridge, in air-tight containers or zip-lock bags. However, they are best enjoyed fresh with good company.</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully cut the Pastry horizontally.</li>
            <li>Gently spread 1 tablespoon of Cream on one side of the Pastry, and 1 tablespoon of compote on the other side.</li>
            <li>Lightly put the sides back together.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this homemade take on a famous Canadian sweet-treat! Don't mind the flakey crumbs that will cover your shirt; that's apart of the Canadian Flakie experience!</li>
